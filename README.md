# MDPD - Microbiome Database of Pulmonary Diseases
A database for taxonomic profiling, similarity and differential analyses of gut and lung microbiome of
pulmonary diseases.

MDPD is a manually curated human gut-lung microbiome database of seven lung diseases namely *Asthma*,
*COPD*, *COVID-19*, *Cystic Fibrosis*, *Lung Cancer*, *Pneumonia* and *Tuberculosis*. It contains a
total of *5970 runs* compiled from *64 BioProjects*. It is developed to provide insights about the
microbiome profiles of lung and gut in pulmonary diseases.

## Accessing the database
MDPD is available at: [http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd](http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd).

The data statistics of MDPD is available in the [Statistics](http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd/statistics.php)
page. Please refer to the [Help](http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd/help.html) page for
understanding how to use the database. The list of BioProjects along with their external links to the
NCBI BioProject is given in the [About](http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd/about.php) page.
The R script for performing the computational analysis pipeline is available
[here](http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd/R/computational_analysis_pipeline.R).

## Analyses performed in MDPD
* **Hierarchical taxonomic composition** of specific metagenome was visualized as Krona plots.
* **Differential markers** (genus/species) were identified using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
* **Abundances of differential markers** were visualized as heatmaps.
* **Shared microbial taxa** between lung and gut microbiome were identified based on prevalence and detection.
