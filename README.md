# Microbiome Database of Pulmonary Diseases (MDPD)
MDPD unveils diverse microbial patterns across wide range of human body sites highlighting variations in different subtypes of pulmonary diseases. It contains a total of **59,362** runs compiled from **430** BioProjects. 
It is a manually curated microbiome database of 19 lung diseases and healthy categorized broadly into six groups namely _Obstructive_, _Restrictive_, _Vascular_, _Infectious_, _Malignancy_ and _Healthy_. 

## Accessing the database
MDPD is available at: [http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd](http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd). The data statistics of MDPD is available in the [Statistics](http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd/statistics.php)
page. Please refer to the [Help](http://bicresources.jcbose.ac.in/ssaha4/mdpd/help.html) page for understanding how to use the database.

## Groups
* **Obstructive diseases** - Asthma, COPD, Bronchiectasis, Bronchitis, Asthma-COPD Overlap (ACO), and COPD-Bronchiectasis Association (CBA)
* **Restrictive diseases** - ARDS, Cystic Fibrosis, ILD, IPF, Sarcoidosis, and Pneumonitis
* **Vascular diseases** - Pulmonary Hypertension
* **Infectious diseases** - Bronchiolitis, COVID-19, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and Other Pulmonary Infections (OPI)
* **Malignancy diseases** - Lung Cancer
* **Healthy**

## Microbiome sites
It is developed to provide insights about the microbiome profiles of 10 microbiome sites in human body, namely _Nasal_, _Oral_, _Upper Repiratory Tract_, _Lower Respiratory Tract_, _Lung_, _Stomach_, _Large Instestine_, _Gut_, _Rectum_ and _Anus_.

## Data Summary
* Amplicon-16S, Amplicon-ITS, and whole metagenome sequencing.
* 430 BioProjects and 59,362 runs/samples.
* 19 different pulmonary diseases and a healthy group.
* 278 subgroups different diseases and healthy.
* 10 human microbiome body sites.
* Microbial information of Bacteria (n = 2296), Eukaryota (n = 219), Virus (n = 193), and Archaea (n = 13).

## Features of MDPD
MDPD captures the dynamics of the microbes in different human body sites, including their,
* Composition and abundance,
* Association of the microbes with various covariates (age, gender, smoking status),
* Microbial markers for different groups (diseases/healthy) and their subgroups,
* Cross-disease or healthy subgroup comparisons, and
* Microbial community structure.

## R scripts
All the R scripts used in developing the database are given in the `R/` folder.
